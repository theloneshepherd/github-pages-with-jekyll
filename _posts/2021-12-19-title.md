This is my first post. This week we have dove into Harvards Extension School EdX's Cs50 Course; I have completed all lab work and problem solution projects of both week 0 and week 1. Asa we move onto week two, things get a little more difficult. I presume i will be faced with a steep learning curve as things go on. So as not to get brain fatigue, I'm going to also focus on building out a solid git profile for potential employers.
